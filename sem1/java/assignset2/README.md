1. Design a “Student” class having fields like “name”, ”rollno” and “address”. Write a derived class called “MSc_Student” having fields like dept and semester. Write proper constructors for both the classes and proper display() method in the derived class to display the details of MSc_Student. Use a Demo class to demonstrate the above.
2. Write a Java program which overloads methods. There is a Shape class having an overloaded method called “area()” with different signatures for different shapes like circle, rectangle and square. Demonstrate the above overloading problem by writing appropriate main() method.
3. Develop an abstract class “TwoDFigure” which will have two variables colour and weight. The inherited class, “Circle” which will have a radius attribute. The super class should have two abstract methods findArea() and findCircumferences(). The Circle class should override both of the abstract methods of the super class.
4. Create a class "Area". Define constructors and respective methods to calculate the area of a square and rectangle. Inherit the properties length and breadth to the class "Volume" to calculate volume of the respective objects like Cubes and Cuboids.
