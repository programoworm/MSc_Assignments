1. Design a “Student” class having fields like “name”, ”rollno” and “address”. Write a derived class called “MSc_Student” having fields like dept and semester. Write proper constructors for both the classes and proper display() method in the derived class to display the details of MSc_Student. Use a Demo class to demonstrate the above.
2. Write a Java program which overloads methods. There is a Shape class having an overloaded method called “area()” with different signatures for different shapes like circle, rectangle and square. Demonstrate the above overloading problem by writing appropriate main() method.
